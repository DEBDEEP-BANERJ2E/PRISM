# PRISM - Predictive Rockfall Intelligence & Safety Management
## Requirements Document

## Introduction

PRISM is an AI-based rockfall prediction and alert system designed for open-pit mines that integrates multi-source data fusion, digital twin technology, and advanced machine learning to provide real-time risk assessment and proactive safety management. The system combines traditional geotechnical monitoring with cutting-edge AI agents, edge computing, and autonomous hardware to create a comprehensive safety ecosystem that not only predicts rockfall events but prescribes optimal response actions.

The system addresses the critical need for proactive slope stability management in open-pit mining operations, where rockfalls pose significant threats to personnel safety, equipment integrity, and operational continuity. By leveraging the latest advances in spatio-temporal deep learning, physics-informed neural networks, and autonomous sensing systems, PRISM aims to transform reactive safety protocols into predictive intelligence platforms.
