# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements real-time database table synchronization between the web dashboard's Data Input page and Supabase database tables. Users can edit tables directly in the UI with changes automatically persisted to the database, creating a seamless database table editor experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to edit table data directly in the Data Input page, so that my changes are immediately saved to the database without manual save actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add a new row to any table in the Data Input page THEN the system SHALL create a corresponding record in the Supabase database table
2. WHEN I edit a cell value in any table THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding field in the database record immediately
3. WHEN I delete a row from any table THEN the system SHALL remove the corresponding record from the database table
4. WHEN I perform any table operation THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating the operation status (success/error)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want the Data Input page to show the current database state when I load or refresh the page, so that I always see the most up-to-date data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the Data Input page THEN the system SHALL fetch and display all current data from the corresponding Supabase tables
2. WHEN I refresh the Data Input page THEN the system SHALL reload all table data from the database
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display tables with the same names as the database tables
4. IF a database table is empty THEN the system SHALL display an empty table with proper column headers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want table names in the UI to match database table names exactly, so that I can easily understand the data structure and relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system displays tables in the Data Input page THEN each table name SHALL match the corresponding Supabase database table name exactly
2. WHEN I create a new table in the UI THEN the system SHALL create a corresponding table in the Supabase database with the same name
3. WHEN database table schemas change THEN the UI SHALL reflect the updated column structure
4. IF a database table doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it with the appropriate schema

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want real-time error handling and validation, so that I'm immediately notified of any data integrity issues or connection problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a database operation fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and revert the UI change
2. WHEN there's a network connectivity issue THEN the system SHALL queue changes and retry when connection is restored
3. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight the problematic field and show validation error details
4. WHEN concurrent edits occur THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts gracefully and notify the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want optimistic UI updates with rollback capability, so that the interface feels responsive while maintaining data consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I make a change THEN the UI SHALL update immediately before the database operation completes
2. IF a database operation fails THEN the system SHALL revert the UI change and show the previous state
3. WHEN multiple users edit the same data THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts and show the latest database state
4. WHEN operations are queued due to connectivity issues THEN the system SHALL show pending operation indicators
