## API Endpoints

### Alert Management
- `POST /api/alerts` - Create new alert
- `GET /api/alerts` - List alerts with filtering and pagination
- `GET /api/alerts/:id` - Get specific alert
- `POST /api/alerts/:id/acknowledge` - Acknowledge alert
- `POST /api/alerts/:id/resolve` - Resolve alert
- `POST /api/alerts/:id/suppress` - Suppress alert temporarily

### Health Checks
- `GET /health` - Basic health check
- `GET /health/ready` - Readiness check with dependencies
- `GET /health/live` - Liveness check

## Configuration

The service uses environment variables for configuration:

### Database
- `DB_HOST` - PostgreSQL host
- `DB_PORT` - PostgreSQL port
- `DB_NAME` - Database name
- `DB_USER` - Database username
- `DB_PASSWORD` - Database password

### Redis (Deduplication)
- `REDIS_HOST` - Redis host
- `REDIS_PORT` - Redis port
- `REDIS_PASSWORD` - Redis password

### Kafka (Event Streaming)
- `KAFKA_BROKERS` - Comma-separated Kafka brokers

### Notifications
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` - Twilio account SID for SMS
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` - Twilio auth token
- `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` - SMS sender number
- `SMTP_HOST` - Email SMTP host
- `SMTP_PORT` - Email SMTP port
- `SMTP_USER` - Email username
- `SMTP_PASSWORD` - Email password
- `EMAIL_FROM` - Email sender address

### Fleet Management
- `FLEET_MANAGEMENT_API_URL` - Fleet management system API URL
- `FLEET_MANAGEMENT_API_KEY` - API key for fleet management

## Alert Processing Flow

1. **Event Reception**: Risk assessments and sensor events received via Kafka
2. **Deduplication Check**: Verify if similar alert already exists
3. **Alert Creation**: Create alert with metadata and context
4. **Prescriptive Actions**: Generate actionable recommendations
5. **Initial Notifications**: Send notifications via configured channels
6. **Escalation Monitoring**: Monitor for acknowledgment and escalate if needed
7. **Fleet Integration**: Execute automatic fleet management actions
8. **Resolution Tracking**: Track resolution and calculate metrics

## Alert Severity Levels

- **INFO**: Informational alerts, email notifications only
- **WARNING**: Warning level, email and push notifications
- **CRITICAL**: Critical alerts, SMS, email, and push notifications
- **EMERGENCY**: Emergency level, all channels including webhooks

## Prescriptive Actions

The system generates context-aware prescriptive actions:

### Rockfall Risk Actions
- **Critical**: Immediate evacuation, operations halt, emergency scaling
- **High**: Access restriction, enhanced monitoring, preventive scaling
- **Medium**: Increased inspection frequency, monitoring adjustments

### Sensor Failure Actions
- **Immediate**: Deploy backup sensors, increase inspection frequency
- **Preventive**: Schedule maintenance, calibration checks

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
Each action includes:
- Estimated implementation cost
- Expected risk reduction percentage
- ROI calculation and payback period
- Implementation timeline and resource requirements

## Escalation Rules

Configurable escalation with:
- Time-based delays (15 min, 30 min, 1 hour, etc.)
- Recipient lists per escalation level
- Business hours restrictions
- Weekend/holiday handling
- Manual escalation override

## Deduplication Rules

Per alert type configuration:
- Time windows (15 min for rockfall, 60 min for sensor failures)
- Spatial proximity (100m for rockfall, exact match for sensors)
- Message similarity thresholds
- Source ID matching requirements

## Fleet Management Integration

Automatic fleet actions:
- **Evacuate**: Remove all vehicles from affected area
- **Stop**: Halt specific vehicle operations
- **Reroute**: Redirect traffic around risk zones
- **Restrict Access**: Block access to dangerous areas

## Monitoring and Metrics

The service provides comprehensive metrics:
- Alert volume and trends by type/severity
- Response time metrics (acknowledgment, resolution)
- Escalation effectiveness
- Notification delivery rates
- False positive/negative rates
- Cost impact of prescriptive actions
