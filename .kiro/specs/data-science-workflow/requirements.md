# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive data science workflow within the web dashboard that allows users to input data, preprocess it through the AI pipeline, configure and train machine learning models, view analytics, generate reports, and perform scenario planning. The workflow creates a seamless end-to-end experience from raw data input to actionable insights for rockfall prediction and risk assessment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Input and Processing Page

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the Data Input page THEN the system SHALL display options for manual table creation and CSV file import
2. WHEN a user creates a manual table THEN the system SHALL allow adding/editing rows and columns with data validation
3. WHEN a user drags and drops a CSV file THEN the system SHALL parse and display the data in table format with proper column headers
4. WHEN imported data is displayed THEN the system SHALL show data preview with pagination for large datasets
5. WHEN a user clicks "Send for Pre-Processing" THEN the system SHALL send data to the AI pipeline preprocessing service
6. WHEN preprocessing is complete THEN the system SHALL save the preprocessed data and notify the user of completion
7. IF preprocessing fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and allow data correction

### Requirement 2: Model Configuration and Training Page

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to configure machine learning models with various parameters and training options so that I can optimize model performance for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the Model Configuration page THEN the system SHALL display available model types for selection

5. WHEN configuring hyperparameters THEN the system SHALL offer both manual input and automated optimization options
6. WHEN a user clicks "Apply" THEN the system SHALL initiate model training with the specified configuration
7. WHEN training is in progress THEN the system SHALL display real-time training progress and metrics
8. IF training fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and suggestions for resolution

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Analytics Page

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view comprehensive data analytics including graphs, plots, and model performance metrics so that I can understand my data and model results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model training completes THEN the system SHALL automatically update the Analytics page with new results
2. WHEN a user visits the Analytics page THEN the system SHALL display interactive charts and graphs of model performance
3. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL show feature importance, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and other relevant metrics
4. WHEN data is available THEN the system SHALL provide data distribution plots, correlation matrices, and statistical summaries
5. WHEN multiple models exist THEN the system SHALL allow comparison between different model performances
6. WHEN a user interacts with charts THEN the system SHALL provide drill-down capabilities and detailed tooltips
7. WHEN analytics are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain chart state and user preferences

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Reports Page

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want to generate and download detailed reports of the entire analysis process so that I can share findings and maintain documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis steps are completed THEN the system SHALL automatically update the Reports page with new information
2. WHEN a user visits the Reports page THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive report including data summary, model configuration, results, and recommendations
3. WHEN viewing reports THEN the system SHALL show sections for data preprocessing, model training, validation results, and key insights
4. WHEN a user clicks the download button THEN the system SHALL generate and download a PDF report with all current information
5. WHEN reports are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain version history and allow access to previous report versions
6. WHEN generating PDFs THEN the system SHALL include all charts, tables, and formatted text with proper styling
7. IF PDF generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative export formats and clear error messages

### Requirement 5: Advanced Scenario Planning Page

**User Story:** As a decision maker, I want to run various scenarios on my analytics data so that I can evaluate different conditions and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses Scenario Planning THEN the system SHALL load available analytics data and trained models
2. WHEN creating scenarios THEN the system SHALL allow modification of input parameters and environmental conditions
3. WHEN running scenarios THEN the system SHALL use trained models to predict outcomes under different conditions
4. WHEN scenarios complete THEN the system SHALL display comparative results and risk assessments
5. WHEN viewing scenario results THEN the system SHALL provide visualization of different outcomes and their probabilities
6. WHEN multiple scenarios exist THEN the system SHALL allow side-by-side comparison and ranking by risk level
7. WHEN scenarios are saved THEN the system SHALL allow users to name, organize, and retrieve previous scenario analyses

### Requirement 6: Navigation and Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless navigation between workflow pages so that I can efficiently move through the data science process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is in the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show the Data Input page between Dashboard and Risk Assessment in the navigation
2. WHEN a user completes data preprocessing THEN the system SHALL enable navigation to the Model Configuration page
3. WHEN model training completes THEN the system SHALL automatically enable access to updated Analytics and Reports pages
4. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL preserve user progress and data state
5. WHEN workflow steps are incomplete THEN the system SHALL provide clear indicators of required actions
